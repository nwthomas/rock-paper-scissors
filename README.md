# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

The classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game brought to you in vanilla Javascript. I had a lot of fun creating the algorithms for this game, and will revisit it to flesh out the site and make it more functional. This was a class assignment from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
